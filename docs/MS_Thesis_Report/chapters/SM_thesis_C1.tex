\chapter{Introduction}

The spectacular detection of gravitational waves from merging binary black
holes by Advanced LIGO~\cite{Event_0, Event_2} has firmly inaugurated the era
of gravitational wave astronomy. Future detections of merging binary black
holes (BBH), binary neutron stars (BNS), or neutron star-black hole (NSBH)
binaries by Advanced LIGO and other upcoming  gravitational wave
observatories~\cite{KAGRA, Virgo, LIGO_india} would enable us to probe the
strong-field, dynamical regime of gravity in much greater detail, allowing for
more stringent tests of the theory of general relativity ~\cite{Berti2015}, and
would help in understanding the nature of matter at supra-molecular densities,
for example, in the core of neutron stars~\cite{Agathos,Chatziioannou}. In
addition, joint observations in the electromagnetic and gravitational wave band
is expected to open up a new domain of multi-messenger astronomy that could
provide crucial insights into the progenitors of highly energy events such as
short gamma-ray bursts~\cite{Arun2014} and Type 1a or core-collapse
supernovae~\cite{Falta2011,Ott2013}.

% \section{Gravitational radiation from compact binaries}

Gravitational waves (GWs) are solutions to the vacuum Einstein's field
equations, generated by sources with a time-varying quadrupole
moment~\cite{Creighton}. These waves couple very weakly with matter, which
make them astrophysically very interesting, but also make them extremely
difficult to detect. They carry away energy, linear and angular momentum from
the system, and therefore, a compact binary radiating GWs, would eventually
coalesce~\cite{Peters1963}.
% The gravitational wave (GW) emission from a compact binary merger, for eg.,
% from a BBH, BNS or NSBH system has a characteristic form, and can has been
% conventionally divided into three distinct phases---the inspiral, the merger
% and the ringdown~\cite{Event_0}. The inspiral waveform can be characterized as
% a chirp signal, i.e., it increases both in amplitude and time throughout the
% inspiral phase. This is followed by the merger, where one expects peak GW
% luminosity, and finally the ringdown stage, where the final remnant emits GW
% radiation and settles to into stationary state.
These waves encode information about the astrophysical source that
generates them. In particular, if one or both of the spin angular momenta of
the components is misaligned with the total angular momentum of the binary,
the orbit is expected to precess~\cite{Apostolatos1994}, which introduces rich
structure in the inspiral phase of the waveform; see~Fig.~\ref{fig:waveforms}.
Observing and analyzing precessing systems, therefore, would enable us to
investigate the spin-orientations of the components, that could provide
astrophysically significant information about their formation
channel~\cite{AstrophysicalImplications,Rodriguez}, as well as the interesting
dynamics of these systems.

% One of the key goals of gravitational wave astronomy is to faithfully estimate
% the astrophysical parameters---masses and spins of the components of the
% binary, source location in the sky, and the equation of state if the signal if
% the source comprises of neutron stars---encoded in the gravitational wave
% signal. Parameter estimation, however, is a non-trivial  problem; it scales
% both in theoretical complexity and computational cost as more physical details
% such as spin-induced precession and tidal effects are added to the waveform
% model. Concretely, for precessing systems, the problem is two fold: first, the
% cost of generating precessing waveforms is much higher than their non-precessing 
% counterparts, and second, parameter estimation studies for
% precessing systems need a higher dimensional, and highly dense template bank,
% which leads to a major increase in the overall computational
% cost~\cite{Nat2017}.

% At the same time, accurate waveform models are crucial if one wants to
% faithfully recover the source parameters; un-modeled parameters in the
% waveform model leads to systematic biases in the estimation~\cite{Bias_1,
% Bias_2}.  It is now known that studies that neglect precession are expected to
% suffer from systematic bias in the estimated parameters; see~\cite{Bias_1,
% Bias_3}  for a discussion. Spin-induced precession~\cite{Apostolatos1994} is a
% generic feature of compact binaries.  Therefore, there is a need to
% incorporate the effects of precession in a waveform model in a computationally
% efficient manner.

SpinTaylorF2 ~\cite{Lundgren2014} is a computationally efficient
and analytically-tractable, frequency waveform model for GWs emitted during
the inspiral phase from single-spin precessing binaries, such as NSBH systems.
For NSBH systems, the black hole (BH) spin can, in principle, reach the limit
predicted by GR and can have any generic orientation. However, indirect
observations suggest that the spin of the companion NS would be much smaller.
While isolated NS are known to have dimensionless spin up to $\sim 0.4$ in the
case of PSR~J1748-2446ad~\cite{PSR2006}, the spin of NS in binary systems is
observered to be much lesse: the fastest spinning pulsar in a double NS
binary (PSR~J0737-3039A) has a spin $\sim 0.05$~\cite{BURGAY2003}. Hence, for
all practical purposes, the spin of NS can be neglected \cite{Lorimer:2008se}.

The SpinTaylorF2 waveform can be expressed as a sum of five sidebands (also
referred to as spin-harmonics) and each sideband corresponds to a modulation
of a leading order function. The relative amplitude of the sidebands depend on
the extent of precession of the system. One can therefore ask whether it's
possible to use a single (or a combination of) sideband(s) for probing the
precession of the system. In this project, we determine if such an approach is
indeed possible, and the regions of parameter space where the approach would
be applicable. Further, we use the information on the relative contribution
different sidebands to the full waveform to put bounds on one of the spin
parameters of the source. In addition, we perform a Fisher matrix analysis for
a specific set of sidebands and investigate the possibility of constructing a
template bank for precessing systems using indivial harmonics of the
SpinTayloF2 model.
