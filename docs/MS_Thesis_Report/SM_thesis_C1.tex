\chapter{Introduction}

The spectacular detection of gravitational waves from merging binary black
holes by Advanced LIGO~\cite{Event_0, Event_2} has firmly inaugurated the era
of gravitational wave astronomy. Future detections of merging binary black
holes (BBH), binary neutron stars (BNS), or neutron star-black hole (NSBH)
binaries by Advanced LIGO and other upcoming  gravitational wave
observatories~\cite{KAGRA, Virgo, LIGO_india} would enable us to probe the
strong-field, dynamical regime of gravity in much greater detail, allowing for
more stringent tests of the theory general relativity ~\cite{Berti2015}, and
would help in understanding the nature of matter at supra-molecular densities,
for example, in the core of neutron stars~\cite{Agathos,Chatziioannou}. In
addition, joint observations in the electromagnetic and gravitational wave band
is expected to open up a new domain of multi-messenger astronomy that could
provide crucial insights into the progenitors of highly energy events such as
short gamma-ray bursts~\cite{Arun2014} and Type 1a or core-collapse
supernovae~\cite{Falta2011,Ott2013}.

\section{Gravitational radiation from compact binaries}

Gravitational waves are solutions to the vacuum Einstein's field equations,
generated by sources with a time-varying quadrupole moment~\cite{Creighton}.
These waves couple very weakly with matter, which makes them astrophysically
very interesting, but also makes them extremely difficult to detect. They
carry away energy, linear and angular momentum from the system, and therefore,
a compact binary radiating GWs, would eventually
coalesce~\cite{Peters1963}, in contrast to the Newtonian case, where there is
no orbital decay due to the absence of GW radiation.

The gravitational wave (GW) emission from a compact binary merger, for eg.,
from a BBH, BNS or NSBH system has a characteristic form, and can has been
conventionally divided into three distinct phases---the inspiral, the merger
and the ringdown~\cite{Event_0}. The inspiral waveform can be characterized as
a chirp signal, i.e., it increases both in amplitude and time throughout the
inspiral phase. This is followed by the merger, where one expects peak GW
luminosity, and finally the ringdown stage, where the final remnant emits GW
radiation and settles to into stationary state.

Gravitational waves encode information about the astrophysical sources that
generate them. In particular, if one or both of the spin angular momenta of
the components is misaligned with the total angular momentum of the binary,
the orbit is expected to precess~\cite{Apostolatos1994}, which introduces rich
structure in the inspiral phase of the waveform, see~Fig.~\ref{fig:waveforms}.
Observing and analyzing precessing systems, therefore, would enable us to
investigate the spin-orientations of the components, that could provide
astrophysically significant information about their formation
channel~\cite{AstrophysicalImplications,Rodriguez}, as well as the interesting
dynamics of these systems, in addition to breaking several degeneracies in the
estimated parameters of the source~\cite{Shag}.

\section{The problem of parameter estimation}

One of the key goals of gravitational wave astronomy is to faithfully estimate
the astrophysical parameters---masses and spins of the components of the
binary, source location in the sky, and the equation of state if the signal if
the source comprises of neutron stars---encoded in the gravitational wave
signal. Parameter estimation, however, is a non-trivial  problem; it scales
both in theoretical complexity and computational cost as more physical details
such as spin-induced precession and tidal effects are added to the waveform
model. Concretely, for precessing systems, the problem is two fold: first, the
cost of generating precessing waveforms is much higher than their non-precessing 
counterparts, and second, parameter estimation studies for
precessing systems need a higher dimensional, and highly dense template bank,
which leads to a major increase in the overall computational
cost~\cite{Nat2017}.

At the same time, accurate waveform models are crucial if one wants to
faithfully recover the source parameters; un-modeled parameters in the
waveform model leads to systematic biases in the estimation~\cite{Bias_1,
Bias_2}.  It is now known that studies that neglect precession are expected to
suffer from systematic bias in the estimated parameters; see~\cite{Bias_1,
Bias_3}  for a discussion. Spin-induced precession~\cite{Apostolatos1994} is a
generic feature of compact binaries.  Therefore, there is a need to
incorporate the effects of precession in a waveform model in a computationally
efficient manner.

\section{SpinTaylorF2---a possible solution}

The SpinTaylorF2 waveform~\cite{Lundgren2014} is a computationally efficient
and analytically-tractable, frequency waveform model for gravitational waves
emitted during the inspiral phase from generic precessing binaries that is
applicable to a single-spin binary. The model therefore, can be applied NSBH
binaries since the neutron star in a binary is expected to have negligible
spin~\cite{Brown2012, Kramer}. Notably, the waveform can be
expressed as a sum of five terms (referred to as spin-harmonics or sidebands)
and each sideband corresponds to a modulation of a leading order function. The
relative amplitude of the sidebands depend on the extent of precession of the
system. One can therefore ask whether it's possible to use a single (or a
combination of) sideband(s) for parameter estimation, instead of the full
SpinTaylorF2 waveform, which could offer a significant reduction of
computational cost.

In this project, we determine if such an approach is indeed possible, and the
regions of  parameter space where the approach would be applicable. We do this
by computing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the full SpinTaylorF2
waveform, and then investigating the fractional SNR contribution of each of
the sidebands to the total SNR, by computing the overlap of
the sideband with the full waveform, in different regions of the parameter
space. We find that different sidebands are dominant for the precessing and
the non-precessing case, and exploit this complementarity to put bounds on one
of the spin-alignment parameter of the source. Further, we perform a Fisher
matrix study for each of the sidebands, and investigate the
feasibility of constructing a template back from individual spin-harmonics,
instead of using the full SpinTaylorF2 waveform.
